Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room asked us to turn their Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based game. They need the web version to work with multiple teams and players and ensure that each game, team, and player is unique. To move the game from Android to the web while keeping the same features, such as supporting multiple teams and making sure each instance is unique. The new web game should work well with the existing Android version. Use Java for the web version because it's compatible with Android. Implement design patterns like Singleton to handle game instances and Iterator to avoid duplicates. Use UML diagrams to plan the system and focus on making it scalable and maintainable.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The best part of creating the documentation was clearly explaining the design patterns and how they would be used. For example, explaining the Singleton pattern for managing game instances and the Iterator pattern for ensuring unique names was very helpful. This clarity made it easier for both the development team and the client to understand how the system would work.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document was very useful for coding. It helped break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could change one part of the documentation, I would add more detailed diagrams and explanations in the System Architecture section. While it gives a good overview, more details on how different parts of the system interact would make it easier to implement and troubleshoot.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Understanding what the users need was crucial for the design. By focusing on ensuring each game, team, and player is unique, we made sure the system would provide a good gameplay experience. Meeting user needs helps in creating a game that is both functional and enjoyable.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I would apply patterns like Singleton and Iterator to solve specific problems. Use diagrams to plan the system structure and interactions before coding. Design the system so it can handle future expansion and increased user loads. 

This helps show the importance of organization and team effort.
